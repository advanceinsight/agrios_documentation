# AgriOS and Odoo Community

AgriOS is built on top of the Odoo Community edition, leveraging its robust open-source ERP framework to deliver powerful agricultural management solutions. By utilizing Odoo Community as the foundation, AgriOS benefits from a mature, modular architecture and a large ecosystem of business applications.

## Why Odoo Community?

Odoo Community is a widely adopted open-source ERP platform known for its flexibility, scalability, and active global community. It provides a solid base for building custom business solutions, with modules for accounting, inventory, CRM, sales, and more. AgriOS extends these capabilities with specialized features for the agricultural sector.

## Integration with AgriOS

AgriOS builds upon Odoo Community by adding agricultural-specific modules, workflows, and user interfaces. This integration allows users to manage crops, livestock, field operations, and compliance within the familiar Odoo environment, while taking advantage of Odoo’s core business features.

## Customization and Extensibility

Developers can further extend AgriOS by creating new modules or adapting existing ones, thanks to Odoo’s open architecture. This ensures AgriOS can evolve alongside the changing needs of the agricultural industry.
